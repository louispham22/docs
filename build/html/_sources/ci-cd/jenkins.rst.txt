Welcome to the Jenkins user documentation - for people wanting to use Jenkins's existing functionality and plugin features.

What is Jenkins?
================
Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
